# Animal_Simulator
 
This project involves creating a 2D virtual world simulation that models animal behavior. The simulation includes different types of terrain tiles and animal avatars, each with their own behaviors. The avatars can move around the map, eat vegetation, and change their behaviors. One avatar, a human, can calculate the best path to a location using the A* algorithm and move there one tile at a time. The simulation also includes a factory pattern for creating terrain tiles and avatars, and custom exceptions for handling errors. The final deliverable involves refactoring some of the existing code and adding new capabilities to the simulation. The simulation is visualized using the DuDraw library.
